# Botnet-Detection-Project-
We present a Deep Learning approach for Android botnet detection  based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our proposed botnet detection system is implemented as a  CNN-based model that is trained on 342 static app features to distinguish between botnet apps and normal apps
